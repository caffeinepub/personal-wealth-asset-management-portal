  "summary": "Implemented service worker cache versioning (v11) with cache cleanup and SPA offline fallback, plus an in-app update notice and supporting hook/registration utilities. Updated Windows offline bundle metadata/scripts/docs to Version 11. However, the diff also includes backend/main.mo changes that appear unrelated to cache busting/rebuild goals and may constitute new functionality beyond the request. The build/redeploy artifact production itself cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-56",
      "requirement": "Produce Version 11 as a clean rebuild and redeploy of the current application state, ensuring all previously requested changes are included in the deployed artifacts (frontend build output and offline Windows bundle).",
      "reason": "The diff shows code/config changes and offline-bundle metadata updates, but does not provide evidence of an actual clean rebuild/redeploy process completion or regenerated build artifacts (e.g., dist output) being produced from the same Version 11 build, nor anything verifying deployed modules load without runtime errors.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is limited to Version 11 rebuild/deploy correctness and cache/update behavior; backend functional changes (profiles, permissions) are not mentioned and are explicitly discouraged as 'new product features'.",
